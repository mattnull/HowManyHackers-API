HowManyHackers API
-----------------
The How Many Hackers API is a collection of trends and statistics about developers and designers in the industry.
This includes what sort of technologies are most used, what age groups use these, where they are located, etc.
This granularity of the data will improve over time, but for now we are attempting to collect this <a href="http://howmanyhackers.com">basic data</a>.

We will begin development on the API once we have a little more data.

Please help this project by contributing <a href="http://howmanyhackers.com">your own data</a>.
